Push Notification using Scala
---------------------------------
In this simple example we use the [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) Cross Platform Push Notification Delivery.
For receive the notification we used the hybrid mobile App developed with [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) you can see the example we used [here](https://github.com/robsonoduarte/learn-cordova/tree/master/push-notification).
For more information how you can use the OneSignal API see [thi video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jexwbrSFpY&feature=youtu.be)
